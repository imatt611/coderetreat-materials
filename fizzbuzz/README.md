## Overview
FizzBuzz is a programming problem that is often used as a simple programming interview qeustion.  Here, we're using it as a method to demonstrate test driven development and pairing.  Its origins come from a group word game for children to teach them about division.  The earliest mention of FizzBuzz is in a book called 'The Young Folk's Cyclopædia of Games and Sports' from 1890! https://books.google.com/books?id=h4QCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false


## Problem
* Write a program that prints out numbers from 1 to 20. 
* For multiples of three, print “fizz” instead of the number. 
* For multiples of five, print “buzz”. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five (i.e. 15), print “fizzbuzz”.

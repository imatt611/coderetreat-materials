## Overview
FizzBuzz is a programming problem that is often used as a simple programming interview qeustion.  It is also used as a method of demonstrating test driven development.  Its origins come from a group word game for children to teach them about division.

The earliest mention of FizzBuzz is in a book called 'The Young Folk's Cyclopædia of Games and Sports' from 1890! https://books.google.com/books?id=h4QCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false


## Problem
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## How to start testing in Golang

This guide assumes you're using VSCode.  We recommend it as a full-featured IDE for Coderetreats, and suggest you install it prior to the day of your Coderetreat.  You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. It's free, awesome, and very easy to install and use.

This guide also assumes you have Go installed. To check if you have Go installed, you can type `go version`.

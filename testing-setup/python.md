## How to start testing in Python

This guide assumes you're using VSCode.  We recommend it as a full-featured IDE for Coderetreats, and suggest you install it prior to the day of you Coderetreat.  You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. It's free, awesome, and very easy to install and use.

This guide also assumes you have python installed.  To check it you have python installed, you can type `python -V`.

First, it's a good idea to create a project location to house all the work you're going to be doing today.  Here's an example of creating one called `coderetreat`.  

- Open your VSCode window and click on the `x0 !0` icon in the bottom left corner of the window.  This will open a terminal window in VSCode; you can also select `View -> Terminal` or `Terminal -> New Terminal` from the menu.  VSCode will create a bash or powershell window, depending on whether you're using a Mac or Windows computer.
- (Optional) Browse to the location you'd like to create this folder
- Inside the terminal window, type the following:

```
mkdir coderetreat
cd coderetreat
``` 
- Now let's create our first python test file.  Create a new file inside the coderetreat folder called `test.py`.
